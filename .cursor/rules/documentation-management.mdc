# Documentation Management Guidelines

## Documentation Organization

All markdown documentation files must be stored in the `documentation/` directory, with the exception of [README.md](mdc:README.md) which must remain at the project root.

### Directory Structure

```
/
├── README.md (root-level project overview)
└── documentation/
    ├── architecture.md
    ├── database.md
    ├── testing.md
    └── ... (other documentation files)
```

## Documentation Maintenance

**Critical Rule**: Whenever you modify code in the project, you **must**:

1. **Identify affected documentation**: Determine which documentation files in the `documentation/` directory are related to the code changes
2. **Update the documentation**: Ensure all relevant documentation is updated to reflect the code changes
3. **Maintain accuracy**: Keep documentation synchronized with the actual implementation
4. **Update references**: If adding new documentation files, update [README.md](mdc:README.md) to reference them

## Documentation Philosophy: Current State Only

**IMPORTANT**: Documentation must reflect **only the current state** of the application, not the history of changes.

### DO ✅

- **Replace outdated information** with current implementation details
- **Update documentation** to match the new code after refactoring
- **Describe how the application works now**, not how it used to work
- **Keep documentation concise** and focused on current functionality

### DON'T ❌

- **Don't track change history** in documentation files (use git for version history)
- **Don't add "Previously..." or "Old implementation..."** sections
- **Don't document refactoring steps** or migration paths
- **Don't maintain changelog-style documentation** in technical documentation files
- **Don't keep deprecated code examples** or outdated architectural descriptions

### Example

When refactoring database queries to use `db/queries` helpers:

```markdown
❌ WRONG - Documenting history:
## Database Queries

Previously, we used direct Drizzle queries in components. After refactoring,
we now use helper functions in db/queries/...

✅ CORRECT - Current state only:
## Database Queries

All database operations use helper functions located in db/queries/...
```

**Note**: If historical information is critical for understanding the project's evolution, maintain it in git commit messages or a separate `CHANGELOG.md` file, not in technical documentation.

## README.md Structure

The [README.md](mdc:README.md) file at the project root serves as the main entry point and must include:

1. **Project Description**: A general description of what the project does
2. **Architecture Overview**: High-level architecture and project structure
3. **Technologies Used**: List of frameworks, libraries, and tools used in the project
4. **Functional Description**: What the application does from a functional perspective
5. **Documentation Index**: A comprehensive list of all documentation files in the `documentation/` directory with:
   - File name (linked)
   - Brief description of the topic covered

### Example Documentation Index Format

```markdown
## Documentation

- [Architecture](documentation/architecture.md) - Detailed system architecture and design patterns
- [Database](documentation/database.md) - Database schema, migrations, and query patterns
- [Testing](documentation/testing.md) - Testing strategy, test structure, and guidelines
- [API](documentation/api.md) - API endpoints and integration guides
```

## When Creating New Features

When adding new features or making significant changes:

1. Create or update relevant documentation files in `documentation/`
2. Ensure [README.md](mdc:README.md) includes references to the new documentation
3. Write documentation in English only
4. Use clear, concise language with code examples where appropriate

## Workflow Checklist

Before completing any code modification task:

- [ ] Code changes are complete
- [ ] Related documentation files are identified
- [ ] Documentation files are updated to reflect changes
- [ ] [README.md](mdc:README.md) references all documentation files
- [ ] All documentation is in English
- [ ] All documentation is in the `documentation/` directory (except README.md)
