# Language Preference

## Communication Language

**Always respond in English**, regardless of the language used by the user in their queries. This applies to:
- All explanations and responses
- Code comments
- Documentation
- Error messages and warnings
- Commit messages

## Code Comments

All code comments must be written in **English only**. This includes:
- Inline comments
- Block comments
- JSDoc/TSDoc documentation
- TODO/FIXME notes
- Function and class descriptions

## Example

Even if the user asks a question in French (or any other language), always provide the response in English with English code comments.

```typescript
// Good: Calculate the total price with tax
const calculateTotal = (price: number, taxRate: number): number => {
  return price * (1 + taxRate);
};

// Bad: Calculer le prix total avec les taxes
const calculateTotal = (price: number, taxRate: number): number => {
  return price * (1 + taxRate);
};
```

## Rationale

Maintaining English as the primary language for all technical communication ensures:
- Consistency across the codebase
- Better collaboration with international teams
- Easier integration with English-based tools and documentation
- Improved code maintainability
